# Hey, I'm Sam Walsh

Front-end developer in training. I'm learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript the old-school way—no frameworks, no fluff, just clean code.

## What I'm working on

- Building a full portfolio site from scratch
- Completing a 6-month front-end challenge
- Creating small projects that focus on real-world skills
- Learning Git, GitHub, and the full dev workflow

## Tools I’m using

- VS Code
- Git & GitHub
- Figma (free version)
- Microsoft Edge for dev tools

## The mission

I’m not just learning to code—I’m learning to think like a developer. My goal is to become a freelance front-end dev within the year and build websites that are fast, clean, and user-friendly.
